## Hi there 👋
This is Raisa Mehnaj. I am a graduate student at North Carolina State University and currently working as an Traffic Engineering Intern in Baseline Mobility Group, Inc. 
I am new to github and learning this field will help me in my upcoming project at my office. This project is based on traffic analysis on TransModeler. I am looking for help with getting started with github. 
You can reach me at r.mehnaj@baselinemobility.com

Fun fact: I love traveling and clicking pictures of myself 😂 🤐 🫥
